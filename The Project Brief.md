# THE HISTORY NEWS MUSIC WEBSITE
<h3>The First Checkpoint</h3>
<p>This project will provide you the music that have been composed in WW2 with the animation of tank that will show when the website is complete</p>
<p>I'm mainly focussing at the layout for how the web haven't touched any js code and it's have some bugs and didn't work out so well and I'm curently on the way to fixing it</p>
<p>The js seem not working properly so I'll not send it in this checkpoint<p>
<p>The nearly completed page will be presented to the professor in checkpoint 2 with more function on the web</p>
